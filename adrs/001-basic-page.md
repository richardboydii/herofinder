# ADR 001 - Basic Page

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2025-08-06

## Context

We are building a single page web application that will display a simple Hello World greeting and will be hosted on Amazon S3 and Amazon CloudFront. The page should use React for the framework and be written in TypeScript that is compatible with the [Google TypeScript](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html). The project directory structure should fallow React best practices and be able to develop locally.

## Consequences

### Positive

- React gives us a great foundation on which to build a more complex web application.

### Negative

- React may be overkill for a basic website.

## User Stories

**US-001: Basic Hello World Display**
As a user visiting the website, I want to see a "Hello World" greeting displayed on the page so that I know the application is working correctly.

**US-002: Responsive Design**
As a user on any device, I want the Hello World page to display properly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices so that I have a consistent experience across platforms.

**US-003: Fast Loading**
As a user, I want the page to load quickly so that I don't have to wait to see the content.

**US-004: Local Development**
As a developer, I want to be able to run the application locally during development so that I can test changes before deployment.
